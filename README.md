## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

### Time and Space Complexity

The space complexity for Bubble Sort is **O(1)**, because only a single additional memory space is required i.e. for temp variable. Also, the best case time complexity will be **O(n)**, it is when the list is already sorted.
